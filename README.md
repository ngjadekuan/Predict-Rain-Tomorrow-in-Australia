# Predict-Rain-Tomorrow-in-Australia
Programming language: Python and Spark 

This project is an analysis on the rain in Australia obtained from Kaggle. Pyspark.sql libraries were used to query the data from the database which will be applied with machine learning classification algorithms from pyspark.ml libraries consisting of decision tree, random forest, logistic regression and gradient boosting. Python's Matplotlib was used to construct the visualisations.
